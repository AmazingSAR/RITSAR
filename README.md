# PySAR
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Image Processing Toolbox for Python

This is an initial version of an SAR image processing toolbox using SAR.  To get started, update the Python Dictionaries located in the parameters folder or leave the default values in place.  In main.py in the top level directory, comment out those algorithms you do not wish to use.

Over the coming months, I will update this readme with more detailed instructions as well as interfaces for AFRL Gotcha data and DIRSIG SAR simulated data.

If anyone is interested in collaborating, I can be reached at dm6718@g.rit.edu.
